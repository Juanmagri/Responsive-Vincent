                    <p>Vincent Willem van Gog was a Dutch painter, 
                    famous as one of the most influential <strong>post-impressionist</strong> 
                    artists because of works such as <emph>The Starry Night, Irises, Bedroom in Arles, 
                    Sunflowers and Wheatfield with Crows</emph>, among many others.</p>
                    <p>Van Gogh left the school by the time he was fifteen; he also took pride in 
                    beign self-taught for the rest of his life in terms of art. It is also 
                    well-known that his active period as a painter was only ten years.</p>
                    <p>His last days were marked by psychiatric problems, suffered from 
                    anguish, terror and hallucinations with very intense outbursts of anger.</p>

                    <hr>
                    <h2>29 July 1890</h2>
                    <p>He died at the age of 37. Some people consider he probably might have 
                    commited suicide, but some others think over it was told by him because 
                    he wanted to hide the author of what could have been a possible accident 
                    that led to his death. He died two days later because of his injuries.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>His opus was only recognised after his death, He was not 
                        commercially successful. Considered a failure during his lifetime.</li>
                        <li>He was named after a stillbirth brother.</li>
                        <li>He's also known because of being the artist who cut off his ear. 
                        Although this episode is involved in many supositions.</li>
                        <li><emph>Theo</emph>, his brother was one of the most influential 
                        persons as he financially supported him and it is widely known they 
                        kept a long correspondence by letter. They were so closed that six 
                        months after Vincent's death, Theo went trough a depression himself 
                        and passed away.</li>
                        <li>Many of his works are considered the world's most expensive 
                        paintings ever.</li>
